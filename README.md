# Ohmycodetodo Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.
The challenge is to create an application to manage user task lists (TODOs).
This application will have two parts: Frontend (Angular) and Backend (Java Spring).

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [Node Js]
- [Angular CLI]

## Development server

Run at the root of the project `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

Once we have the dependencies correctly installed, we can run the application.

Run at the root of the project `ng serve -o` for a dev server. It will open the application directly in the browser that you have installed.

If you don't have the Angular CLI, you can run `npm start` and open your browser by opening your browser at http: // localhost: 4200 /



## Application testing

To access the application, you must log in with a valid username and password.

You can find the users in the data.sql file of the Spring Boot application (proofTodoBackend\src\main\resources\data.sql)

All users have password = 'password'
